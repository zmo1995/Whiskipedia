# Introduction 
Whiskipedia is an ios app that allow users to share their reviews on Whisky as well as to look up information about Whisky. 
Whiskipedia is based on services provided by firebase, including user authentication, database with Cloud Firestore and  
image storage using firebase storage.

# Background 
If you develop an interest in exploring the world of whisky, there are an overwhelming number of brands and expressions.
Where to begin? Deciding next you next bottle is not an easy job, and purchasing random whiskey is expensive and not 
practical.There is also an incredibly extensive marketing and PR machine desigined to sell you specific produts, further 
muddying the water for everyday consumer. That's why I developed Whiskipedia, to help user to get better whiskey with 
less cost. With Whiskipedia, you will never have to go to a liquor store and have selection difficulties on which whiskey 
to buy.
